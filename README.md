Okay. I made a thing. Here's how to make it work.

Install ROS. 

Make a workspace

in WS/src - copy this repo. It is setup as a ROS package. 

THAT MEANS WE CAN DO COOL THINGS

add

'source PATH/TO/WS/devel/setup.bash' to your .bashrc

run 'catkin_make'

everything should build and compile and you can launch this by normal rosrun commands
